**  Lesson-21 | Javascript is Asyncronus?
* 
*  1. Javascript executes code line by line, so simply we can call JS is syncronus.
*  2. But what when we run the callback with setTimeout() function. It behaves like asyncronus.
*  3. So the answer is JS is run with any runtime environment that can be a `browser` or `node js` that *     provides some objects like window or global with them it can behave asyncronusly. But Javascript *     is itsele is a syncronus programming.
*  4. Even in ES6, some Asyncronus functionality is added by using `async` and `awaits`. Will discuss in *     future lessons.
