**  Lesson-22 | Threads
* 
*  1. As we all know that today's computers are more powerful, more correctly said that today's CPU are *     more powerful and it have multiple core also they can process thing simultenously.
*  2. To optimize the CPU uses, many programming language uses the threads.
*  3. Process - A currently execution program is called a procees. Each process has some code loaded *     into mamory. Means each process has some memory.
*  4. Thread - The part of the process that can be exeuctes simultenously, are called threads.
*  5. Each thread can have as seperate path of execution and has it different function call stack.
*  6. But the multi-threaded programming like C, C++, Java are difficult to master some thread concepts *     like mutual lock, synchronization, inter thread communication.
*  7. But Javascript is a single threaded programming, but the question is how JS optimizely uses the *     CPU.
